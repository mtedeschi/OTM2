# OpenTreeMap 2 Prototypes

## How to use these files
This folder uses the compiled static directory in /opentreemap/treemap/ for styling and other files. You'll need to add that directory here for images and styling. For the sake of simplicity, I've just been running this using a simple Python server to view/edit these pages.

_template.html - Contains everything from "base.html" and "instance_base.html" templates, refined with all general UI components.
plot_detail.html - Plot/tree detail page based on existing template.
resource_detail.html - Resource detail page, based on plot/tree detail page.
user.html - User profile page, with tabs.

Also, there are some manual overrides on JS files, as well as some minor interactivity added to the bottom of each file.
